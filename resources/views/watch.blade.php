        Instantly receive and respond to your favorite notifications.
        Get the motivation you need to stay active and healthy.
        Express your personal style in a whole new way.
        From the way it works to the way it looks, Apple Watch isn’t just something you wear.
        It’s an essential part of who you are.

    <h2>Never miss what matters.</h2>
      <p>
        Because it’s on your wrist, Apple Watch lets you receive notifications immediately and conveniently.
        The moment the people or apps you care about have something to say, you’ll feel a gentle tap.
        Then you can send just the right response.
        Just like that.

    <h2>Stay motivated. Stay healthy.</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the day, Apple Watch measures your workouts,
      tracks your activity, and helps encourage healthy routines.
      All adding up to a better you.
    </p>

  <div class="col-sm-3">
    <h2>You’ll know it when you feel it.</h2>
    <p>
      When a notification or an alert arrives, a gentle tap lets you know straight away.
      Then a quick glance at your watch tells you if it’s something you need
      to respond to promptly — or not.

    <h2>Choose yours. Then make it even more you.</h2>
    <p>
      We designed Apple Watch to reflect a wide range of tastes and styles.
      And you can make it even more personal by switching straps
      and changing watch faces, anytime you want.

    <h2>Stay fit, whatever your focus.</h2>
    <p>
      Some of us live for running, cycling or hitting the gym.
      For others, it’s about being active throughout the day.
      Apple Watch combines the capabilities of an all-day activity tracker
      with those of a superior sport watch.
      Because it all counts. And it all adds up.

    <h2>Your face says so much.</h2>
    <p>
      Apple Watch faces are designed to be incredibly personal,
      from the way they look to the information you choose to display on them.
      Combine different styles,
      colours and complications to create one that’s a true reflection of you.

  <div class="col-sm-3">
    <h2>There’s an Apple Watch for everyone.</h2>
      <p>
        Start with a case made from strong yet lightweight anodised aluminium.
        Or go with elegantly durable stainless steel.
        Both come in two different sizes and a variety of finishes.
        And since every model is paired with its own beautifully engineered strap,
        you have many unique combinations to choose from.
